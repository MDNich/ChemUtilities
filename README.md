# ChemUtilities

The best chemical reaction calculator out there (in progress) !

Given a reaction, balances it (including redox), given initial conditions calculates all stoichiometric properties, dissolution in aqueous medium, thermochemistry properties, and titration curve if applicable. 
Obviously in development, give it a star to follow progress !

I will post builds as often as I can, please feel free to beta test and report issues !

Also check out my other project with @0xCUB3 https://github.com/0xCUB3/About-This-Hack, as well as my website https://stemrobotics4all.org.
